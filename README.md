A little test for hand recognition and cursor control on python using minimal GPU and processing resources.
Note : you need a few libraries to get this running.

Paste this code into a terminal : pip install mediapipe pyautogui opencv-python

The program is not very efficient and you migh experience framedrops if you are using onboard graphics. Hope to fix this in future and grategul for any suggestions.
GUi update coming soon!
